A pypi server which automatically proxies and mirrors pypi packages based 
upon packages requested. It also supports the uploading of local (private) 
packages.

**Supported Python versions:** 2.6 & 2.7.

Getting started
---------------

Download and install localshop via the following command::

    pip install localshop

This should best be done in a new virtualenv. Now initialize your localshop 
environment by issuing the following command::

    localshop init

If you are upgrading from an earlier version simply run::

    localshop upgrade

And then start it via::

    localshop run_gunicorn
    localshop celery worker -B -E

Celeryd is required to do the mirroring of the pypi packages once they 
are needed.

If you like to start listening on a different HTTP port, you can use after "run_gunicorn" the parameter 0.0.0.0:80, wich will make your sistem to listen all network interfaces on port 80. This affects all URL examples below, because they are using 8000, which is the default HTTP port.

You can also start it via honcho using the Procfile::

    pip install honcho
    honcho start

You can now visit http://localhost:8000/ and view all the packages in your
localshop!

The next step is to give access to various hosts to use the shop. This
is done via the webinterface (menu -> permissions -> cidr). Each ip
address listed there will be able to download and upload packages.
If you are unsure about ips configuration, but still want to use authentication, specify "0.0.0.0/0" as the unique cidr configuration. It will enable for any ip address.


How it works
============

Packages which are requested and are unknown are looked up on pypi via the 
xmlrpc interface.  At the moment the client downloads one of the files which
is not yet mirror'ed a 302 redirect is issued to the correct file (on pypi).  
At that point the worker starts downloading the package and stores it in 
~/.localshop/files so that the next time the package is request it is 
available within your own shop!


Uploading local/private packages
--------------------------------

To upload your own packages to your shop you need to modify/create a .pypirc 
file.  See the following example::

    [distutils]
    index-servers =
        local

    [local]
    username: myusername
    password: mysecret
    repository: http://localhost:8000/simple/

To upload a custom package issue the following command in your package::
    
    python setup.py upload -r local

It should now be available via the webinterace


Using the shop for package installation
=======================================

To install packages with pip from your localshop add `-i` flag, e.g.::
    
    pip install -i http://localhost:8000/simple/ localshop

or edit/create a ~/.pip/pip.conf file following this template::

    [global]
    index-url = http://<access_key>:<secret_key>@localhost:8000/simple

Then just use pip install as you are used to do.
You can replace access_key and secret_key by a valid username and password.

Credentials for authentication
------------------------------

If you don't want to use your Django username/password to authenticate
uploads and downloads you can easily create one of the random credentials
localshop can create for you.

Go to the Credentials section and click on create. Use the access key
as the username and the secret key as the password when uloading packages.
A ``.pypirc`` could look like this::

    [distutils]
    index-servers =
        local

    [local]
    username: 4baf221849c84a20b77a6f2d539c3e8a
    password: 200984e70f0c463b994388c4da26ec3f
    repository: http://localhost:8000/simple/

pip allows you do use those values in the index URL during download, e.g.::

    pip install -i http://<access_key>:<secret_key>@localhost:8000/simple/ localshop

So for example::

    pip install -i http://4baf221849c84a20b77a6f2d539c3e8a:200984e70f0c463b994388c4da26ec3f@localhost:8000/simple/ localshop

.. warning::

    Please be aware that those credentials are transmitted unencrypted over
    http unless you setup your localshop instance to run on a server that
    serves pages via https.

In case you ever think a credential has been compromised you can disable it
or delete it on the credential page.


Adding users
============

You can add users using the Django admin backend at ``/admin``. In order for the
user to be able to generate credentials for his account, he needs the following
four user permissions:

* ``permissions.add_credential``
* ``permissions.change_credential``
* ``permissions.delete_credential``
* ``permissions.view_credential``


Settings
========

There are a few settings to set in ``~/.localshop/localshop.conf.py`` that
change the behaviour of the localshop.

``LOCALSHOP_DELETE_FILES``
--------------------------

:default: ``False``

If set to ``True`` files will be cleaned up after deleting a package or
release from the localshop.

``LOCALSHOP_DISTRIBUTION_STORAGE``
----------------------------------

:default: ``'storages.backends.overwrite.OverwriteStorage'``

The dotted import path of a Django storage class to be used when uploading
a release file or retrieving it from PyPI.

``LOCALSHOP_HTTP_PROXY``
------------------------

:default: ``None``

Proxy configuration used for Internet access. Expects a dictionnary configured
as mentionned by
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#proxies

``LOCALSHOP_ISOLATED``
----------------------

:default: ``False``

If set to ``True`` Localshop never will try to redirect the client to PyPI. 
This is useful for environments where the client has no Internet connection.

.. note::
   If you set ``LOCALSHOP_ISOLATED`` to ``True``, client request can be delayed
   for a long time because the package must be downloaded from Internet before
   it is served. You may want to set pip environment variable 
   ``PIP_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`` to a big value. Ex: ``300``
